Required
ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?

    ðŸŽ¯ Set up user sign-up and user login using Clerk.
    ðŸŽ¯ Create and display an error/not found page if the user visits a page that doesnâ€™t exist.
    ðŸŽ¯ Use 1 or more Radix UI Primitive component, or something similar (e.g. use of a different component library to enhance UX, not just Tailwind).
    ðŸŽ¯ Enable users to create a user profile, and input profile information (such as a user biography) using a form. Users and user information should be stored in their own table in the database and handled with an appropriate route.
    ðŸŽ¯ Enable users to create posts associated with their Clerk userId. Posts should be displayed on the userâ€™s profile page.

I have been able to able to achieve the basic requirements of the assignment. 

ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
Every of the stretc goals! At this time I have looked tried as much as possible to fix the basic requirements. I somehow always get stuck with the basic requirement. This challenge is something I have looked at and hopefully when I have re-read the course material with more time, I will work on fixing every requirement on his project. 


ðŸŽ¯ If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

The stretch goals werent difficult. Its just competence that i would say is the challenge at this time. 


I must also state that I am struggling with the vercel operations. Everything seams to just break each time I try to fix an aspect. At this time my vercel deployment shows an internal server error. Something about my 'Middleware_Invocation_failed'. And I am at loss at how to fix it.

I have not been able to concentrate on my CSS styling because of the worry on errors. This aspect is something that I am not particularly powerful in. I do have to do alot of revision to get used to the syntax
