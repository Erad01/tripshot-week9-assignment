I have been able to able to achieve the basic requirements of the assignment. 

🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
Every of the stretc goals! At this time I have looked tried as much as possible to fix the basic requirements. I somehow always get stuck with the basic requirement. This challenge is something I have looked at and hopefully when I have re-read the course material with more time, I will work on fixing every requirement on his project. 


🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

The stretch goals werent difficult. Its just competence that i would say is the challenge at this time.
